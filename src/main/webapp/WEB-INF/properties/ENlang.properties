analytics_text = Often in the past, learning analytics systems have attempted to analyze past activities to predict future activities in real time. With Moodle Learning Analytics, we are more ambitious. We believe a full learning analytics solution will help us not only predict events, but change them to be more positive.
analytics = analytics

assignment_text = The assignment activity provides a space into which students can submit work for teachers to grade and give feedback on. This saves on paper and is more efficient than email. It can also be used to remind students of real-world assignments they need to complete offline, such as art work, and thus not require any digital content.Student submissions are together on one screen of your course. You can require them to submit one or several files and/or to type text essays. It is possible to have them submit work as a group and you can also choose as a teacher to grade their work 'blind' in other words not to see the identities of those who have submitted assignments. Assignments can have deadlines and cut off dates - which you can also extend if necessary.
assignment = assignment

advanced_grading_text = By default, numerical grades in Moodle are selected by the teacher from a range like 0-100. When advanced grading methods are enabled, the grade selection element is replaced with a more complex assessment form provided by the plugin. The plugin contains the logic how to calculate the grade. Such a calculated grade is then passed back to the activity module as if the teacher used the standard grade value selector.
advanced_grading = advanced grading

badge_text = Badges are a good way of celebrating achievement and showing progress. Badges may be awarded based on a variety of chosen criteria and are fully compatible with Mozilla Open Badges. Badges created in Moodle may be displayed on a users profile or pushed to their Open Badges backpack and public badge collections in their backpack will display in their Moodle profile.
badge = badge

course_text = Courses are the spaces on Moodle where teachers add learning materials and activities for their students. Courses may be created by admins, course creators or managers. Teachers can then add the content and re-organise them according to their own needs. The links below the image will provide more information about creating, organising and managing courses.
course = course

competency_text = A piece of evidence is used as a record of an action that may affect the competency rating of a student. For instance, when a teacher rates a student in a course, a piece of evidence will be created to record who, what, where, when the rating had been done, in this case it would contain as much as: The teacher Bob rated the competency Demonstrates understanding of French of the student Ann in the course Introduction to French with the rating Met on the 3rd of January at 1pm.
competency = competency

forum_text = The forum activity allows students and teachers to exchange ideas by posting comments as part of a thread. Files such as images and media maybe included in forum posts. The teacher can choose to rate forum posts and it is also possible to give students permission to rate each others posts.
forum = forum

grading_text = The grader report collects items that have been graded from the various parts of Moodle that are assessed, and allows you to view and change them as well as sort them out into categories and calculate totals in various ways. When you add an assessed item in a Moodle course, the gradebook automatically creates space for the grades it will produce and also adds the grades themselves as they are generated, either by the system or by you.
grading = grading

lesson_text = The lesson module presents a series of HTML pages to the student who is usually asked to make some sort of choice underneath the content area. The choice will send them to a specific page in the Lesson. In a Lesson pages simplest form, the student can select a continue button at the bottom of the page, which will send them to the next page in the Lesson.
lesson = lesson

messages_text = Unless disabled by the administrator (in Advanced features), teachers, students and other users may send and receive private messages via Moodle. This is in addition to receiving notifications about assignments, forum discussions etc.
messages = messages

question_bank_text = This feature allows a teacher to create, preview, and edit questions in a database of question categories. The categories can be limited to being used on the site, course or quiz level. The questions in a category can be added to a Quiz or to a lesson activity via an export process. 
question_bank = question bank

question_types_text = You may add a variety of different types of questions in the Quiz and Lesson modules. This page is about Quiz module question types, some will be similar to Lesson questions types, which are fewer in number and function differently. The standard quiz question types are listed below with brief descriptions. Please use the links on the right side of this page to find more detailed information about standard questions types.
question_types = question types

roles_text = A role is a collection of permissions defined for the whole system that you can assign to specific users in specific contexts. The combination of roles and context define a specific users ability to do something on any page. The most common examples are the roles of student and teacher in the context of a course.
roles = roles

quiz_text = The Quiz activity module allows the teacher to design and build quizzes consisting of a large variety of Question types, including multiple choice, true-false, short answer and drag and drop images and text. These questions are kept in the Question bank and can be re-used in different quizzes.
quiz = quiz

scorm_text = SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) is a collection of specifications that enable interoperability, accessibility and reusability of web-based learning content. SCORM content can be delivered to learners via any SCORM-compliant Learning Management System (LMS) using the same version of SCORM.
scorm = scorm

survey_text = The Survey module is a course activity that provides a number of verified survey instruments, including COLLES (Constructivist On-Line Learning Environment Survey) and ATTLS (Attitudes to Thinking and Learning Survey), which have been found useful in assessing and stimulating learning in online environments. Teachers can use these to gather data from their students that will help them learn about their class and reflect on their own teaching.

It is adapted as explained in the second reference.</p><p>For more information see:</p><p>R. Agrawal, R. Srikant: Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases. In: 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, 478-499, 1994.
EM = <b>Simple EM (expectation maximisation)</b>class.</p><p class="card-text">EM assigns a probability distribution to each instance which indicates the probability of it belonging to each of the clusters. EM can decide how many clusters to create by cross validation, or you may specify apriori how many clusters to generate.</p> <p class="card-text">The cross validation performed to determine the number of clusters is done in the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>1. the number of clusters is set to 1</li> <li>2. the training set is split randomly into 10 folds.</li> <li>3. EM is performed 10 times using the 10 folds the usual CV way.</li> <li>4. the loglikelihood is averaged over all 10 results.</li> <li>5. if loglikelihood has increased the number of clusters is increased by 1 and the program continues at step 2. </li> </ul> <p class="card-text">The number of folds is fixed to 10, as long as the number of instances in the training set is not smaller 10. If this is the case the number of folds is set equal to the number of instances.
